NXBrew-dl is intended to be an easy-to-user interface to download ROMs, DLC and update files for NSP. It does so via
a GUI interface, allowing users to download items in bulk and keeping things up-to-date.

As of now, this is in extremely early development, and only currently acts as an interactive browser for the ROM
list on NXBrew. Downloads do not yet work!

To get started, see the [documentation](https://nxbrew-dl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

We encourage users to open [issues](https://github.com/bbtufty/nxbrew-dl/issues>) as and where they find them.
